# Racing Standings

## Description

React project to show the standing results of Formula 1 and MotoGP 2023 Championships. The main idea was avoid spoilers for those who haven't seen all the races and are planning to do so. After selecting one championship the user see an empty table to start looking for the results until a specific race or show them all at once.
